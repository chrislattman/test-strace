# `strace` examples

All 5 source code files represent the same program. Each program spawns 2 processes, one after the other, and then creates 2 threads which have to share a mutex.

Each of the log text files were generated by running `strace -f -s 4096 -o <lang>log.txt <program>`, where program is either the compiled binary or the interpreter command (e.g. `python3 tester.py`).

This repository shows how the different languages compare with respect to system call usage.
